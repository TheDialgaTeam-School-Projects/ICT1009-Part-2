    "description": "The MRT delays that occurred on Tuesday (7 February) morning on the East-West Line (EWL) were the result of “urgent works” near Joo Koon MRT station, said SMRT in a Facebook post. The works were to replace a track point, which guides the direction of train travel. Such works usually take place on weekends to minimise the inconvenience caused to commuters. However, due to the “urgency and criticality” of the situation, the train operator began replacement works on Monday night instead. These works were still being carried out as of 2pm on Tuesday. With only one platform at Joo Koon station being in operation, those travelling from Jurong East to Joo Koong “experienced longer journeys this morning (Tuesday)”, the post said. SMRT also added that “their engineers will complete the replacement works and get the track point up and running after the end of service”. Arrangements were also made to minimise the congestion from Jurong East to Joo Koon during Tuesday’s evening peak service period, with SMRT saying it would deploy additional staff to assist commuters at stations.

At about 7.30pm, SMRT posted on Twitter an alert on the track fault, telling commuters to expect an additional 15 minutes of travel time from Outram Park station to Eunos station towards Pasir Ris station. By 8.24pm, the fault had been cleared, according to a post on SMRT’s Twitter page. The second fault happened at about 5.33am on Friday, and halted services between Outram Park station and Aljunied station. A traction power fault was reported near Bugis station during maintenance hours, said SMRT. “Our engineers managed to rectify the fault before the start of service, and train services began on time,” said Ms Margaret Teo, head of Corporate Marketing and Communications at SMRT Corporation. According to a post on its Twitter page, services resumed by 5.43am. SMRT alerted commuters to the third fault at 7.14am on Twitter. A track fault had occurred at Eunos station, causing the trains to travel at slower speeds from Kembangan station to Eunos station.

Two minutes later, SMRT tweeted that the fault was resolved, only to announce at 8:04 am that trains are moving slower, again due to a signal fault. At 8:16 am, they said that an additional 20 minutes of travelling time should be factored in for those travelling on the Circle Line. At 9:06 am, SMRT gave an update, saying there was no train service between Botanic Gardens and Marymount stations. This later extended to Serangoon station, it said at 9:32 am.

Yesterday\u0027s glitch was caused by a westbound train which stalled near Dover station. Operator SMRT tweeted about the delay at 7.01am, warning that travel time from Queenstown to Jurong East - five stations away - would take 20 minutes more than usual. SMRT spokesman Patrick Nathan said the driver of a westbound train reported at around 6.45am that its brakes were stuck. Mr Nathan said this happened \"just before the train entered Dover MRT station\". \"A rescue train was subsequently coupled to the defective train to push it to Dover station for passengers to disembark,\" he added.

The track fault, which happened on Tuesday evening, caused 15 train cars to be damaged and delayed service from about 10pm. Engineers worked through the night to rectify the fault and to replace damaged devices on the train cars, SMRT said in a Facebook post. The damaged trains are at the BPLRT depot at Ten Mile Junction and investigations into the incident are ongoing, it said. Train service on the line only resumed at 6.40am on Wednesday, more than an hour later than scheduled, with just six trains – half the usual number. But at 10.20am, the network encountered a power trip due to another track fault, and 50 passengers had to disembark a train about 20m from Choa Chu Kang station. “A signal rail joint on the BPLRT network was damaged yesterday evening, and the cause is still being investigated. This caused damage to the current collector devices (CCDs) on the BPLRT train cars as they moved over the damaged rail joint,\" SMRT said. \"Preliminary findings show that the damaged current collector devices on the train cars may have further affected other parts of the track network, before they were replaced after service hours last night.\" (CNA, 28 Sep 2016)",

    "description": "Yet, that has been happening the whole of this week. Because of an unknown signal interference in the tunnels, communication between trains and track is lost intermittently. This has the effect of a train going blind and deaf momentarily, and causes yet another fail-safe system to kick in - the emergency brakes. Because the train does not \"know\" where it is going, it stops. Each time a train stops, its signalling system has to be reset to get it to move again. These events, repeated many times a day, causes journeys to be longer and more uncomfortable. Operator SMRT has also decided to man the driverless trains. They take over when the train goes \"blind\" and \"deaf\". The staff onboard, however, do not drive the trains on manual mode completely - not for extended periods of time anyway. So, commuters will continue to face longer and jerkier journeys until the problem is fixed. Experts from systems supplier Alstom have flown in to assist. (ST, 2 Sep 2016)",

Trains ran at significantly slower speeds for about three hours, and regular services resumed at 9.10am. The trip-up on the North-South Line was traced to track-side signalling equipment “near Choa Chu Kang”, transport operator SMRT said, adding that it was investigating the problem. SMRT first tweeted at 6.08am that the fault had crippled train services from the Yew Tee to Bukit Gombak stations, and announced that free regular bus services were available. Although train services resumed about 15 minutes later, Mr Patrick Nathan, SMRT’s vice-president of corporate information and communications, said that trains had to be driven manually at 18kmh through the affected stretch for the safety of passengers. Given that this was down from the usual train speed of 60 to 80kmh, it resulted in slower journeys for commuters and led to congestion in trains and stations, adding up to 20 minutes of extra travelling time between the Woodlands and Jurong East stops.

    "description": "\"Intermittent signalling issues\" affected services along the Circle Line on Monday (Aug 29), according to public transport operator SMRT. This comes after commuters on the Circle Line reported delays in train services, as well as unusual crowds. Its Vice President of Corporate Information and Communications Patrick Nathan said the issues will likely cause delays of about 1 to 2 minutes during non-peak hours and 5 to 10 minutes during peak hours, until the end of service on Monday. \"More SMRT staff have been deployed to our Circle Line stations to assist passengers,\" Mr Nathan said in a statement. \"Our staff will also be on board the Circle Line trains for the rest of the day.\" SMRT also advised commuters standing on board Circle Line trains to hold onto handrails, as they may experience intermittent braking. \"Our engineers are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible,\" Mr Nathan said. Commuters had reported delays along the Circle Line from about 8am on Monday. (CNA, 29 Aug 2016)",

This affected train services in both directions, according to the Land Transport Authority (LTA). Seven stations - from Woodleigh to Punggol - were affected by the disruption, but services progressively resumed. Commuters said on social media that the disruption began as early as 8.50pm. As of 9.54pm, train service at three stations - Punggol, Sengkang and Buangkok - were still down, according to SBS Transit\u0027s Twitter account. At about 10.25pm, SBS Transit informed commuters via Twitter that services were running at all stations. Channel NewsAsia understands that there was a train stuck between Sengkang and Buangkok stations. SBS Transit told commuters that free bus services were available at designated bus stops near affected stations. Crowds were seen waiting for free buses outside Serangoon and Woodleigh stations.

The discharge of freon into the tunnel reduced visibility at parts of the station when the platform screen doors were opened for passengers to exit the train. SMRT staff switched on the tunnel ventilation system immediately to disperse the odourless gas. The train was withdrawn from passenger service to allow the air-conditioning system to be checked. The passenger platform at Tanjong Pagar MRT station remained in service during this incident and train services were not affected. (SMRT, 15 Aug 2016)",

    "description": "In addition to the morning service delays, there was a disruption at lunchtime between Ang Mo Kio and Admiralty stations. An SMRT tweet at 1.25pm advised commuters that they could expect an additional travelling time of 15 minutes between Ang Mo Kio and Admiralty stations heading towards Jurong East. Services were restored 22 minutes later. The Straits Times understands that the delay was due to rectification works for the morning incident at Admiralty. SMRT apologised to commuters affected by the service disruptions and said the loss of power to trackside signalling equipment had caused the interruption between Joo Koon and Boon Lay. \"This caused two west-bound trains to be held between Pioneer and Joo Koon stations,\" said SMRT spokesman Patrick Nathan, adding that power engineers were \"quickly deployed\" to restore power to the affected stretch. The cause of the power fault was being investigated, he said. Meanwhile, the delay on the North-South Line was caused by a \"track point failure\" near Admiralty station, which prevented trains from moving from one track to another. Instead, personnel on the track had to manually allow the trains to switch tracks. (ST, 3 Aug 2016)",

Her first tweet at 4.29pm said that trains were stuck at the station as the platform doors would not open. The doors had to be forced open, she claimed. Another commuter, Zhi Qian, said on Twitter it was a technical problem with the doors at the stations. (ST, 31 Jul 2016)",

    "description": "At 7.53pm, a power dip at Buona Vista power intake station caused a power trip which affected services on certain sections of the North-South and East-West Lines and the Circle Line, as well as the Bukit Panjang LRT network. A power intake station takes power supply from the Power Grid to power sections of the MRT network. There are five such power intake stations along the North-South and East-West Lines, as well as the Circle Line. The specific sectors affected on the East-West Line were Buona Vista to Joo Koon, on the North-South Line from Jurong East to Kranji, while on the Circle Line the stretch affected was from Caldecott to HarbourFront, in both directions. All affected stations were without power except for emergency lighting. Free bus services were activated at 8.15pm. Services on the North-South East-West Lines resumed at 8.23pm, maintaining an initial headway of 7 minutes, while services on the Circle Line resumed at 8.48pm. Four trains on the BPLRT were stalled between stations and 150 passengers were safely detrained. Services on the Bukit Panjang LRT resumed at 9.47pm. (SMRT press release)",

According to an update on the Iris app, train services were unavailable between Chinatown and Farrer Park stations in both directions. According to a sign at an NEL station, SBS Transit said the disruption was due to a power fault at Dhoby Ghaut station. Services along the North-East Line resumed at 11.46am, according to SBS Transit. In response to media queries, SBS Transit said the power fault occurred just after 11am, and caused train services between Outram Park and Farrer Park stations to be disrupted. \"Full service resumed about 40 minutes later,\" said SBS Transit\u0027s senior vice president for Corporate Communications Ms Tammy Tan.

At 6.32am, SMRT sent out another tweet stating that train service from Raffles Place station to Marina South Pier station was unavailable, also due to a train fault. Train service from Marina South Pier to Newton towards Jurong East resumed at 6.53am, SMRT said, while service from Raffles Place to Marina South Pier resumed at 6.57am. In response to media queries, SMRT said the disruption was caused by a locomotive that stalled at Raffles Place. The locomotive is an engineering vehicle used for maintenance work. \"A passenger train was activated to haul the faulty locomotive to Bishan Depot,\" said a spokesperson from SMRT, adding that the cause of the train fault is being investigated. This comes two days after the North-South Line passed the 100-day major incident-free milestone on Monday. (CNA, 21 Apr 2016)",

Service was affected for nearly four hours, with normal service resuming only by 10.10am. Commuters tweeted about the train disruption from as early as 6.30am. Yesterday, SMRT had initially announced that journey times would take 15 minutes longer. It then progressively revised this to 20, 25 and finally, 30 minutes. The disruption affected thousands of commuters travelling during the morning commuting hours from 6.30am to around 9am. Checks carried out by The Straits Times found that neither trains nor stations between Aljunied and Raffles Place were packed from 9.30am. By around 9.40am, station announcements stated that the track fault had been rectified, but service was not up to speed yet because of congestion. Normal service resumed only by 10.10am. SMRT spokesman Patrick Nathan said the disruption was traced to a faulty track signal circuit. (ST, 19 Mar 2016)",

SMRT first announced the fault at 5.43pm on Twitter and told commuters to expect an additional 15 minutes to their travelling time. Nearly 10 minutes later, it said the disruption was due to a train fault and to expect another 25 minutes on top of commuters\u0027 usual travelling time. By 6pm, the public transport operator announced there was no train service between Jurong East and Joo Koon, and that free bus bridging services were available. Two minutes later, it said service had resumed, but within 10 minutes, said commuters would take an extra 20 minutes for their journey due to the recurring fault. Free bus services were made available to affected commuters. At 6.36pm, SMRT tweeted that no train services were available between Jurong East to Joo Koon again, and that they were expected to resume in half an hour. The issue was resolved by 6.42pm, and services on both bounds were up and running again. (CNA, 19 Feb 2016)",

    "incident": "Mishap at Hougang station disrupted service on the North-East Line on 11 Mar 2015",
    "description": "A student’s leg got trapped in a platform gap at Hougang MRT station early Wednesday (11 March), causing a delay in service on the North East Line (NEL). The incident happened just before 8am and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) was alerted to the situation. According to the SCDF, SBS Transit staff and members of the public pulled the student out before they arrived at the scene. The student was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital with no serious injuries. In a statement on Wednesday, Ms Tammy Tan, senior vice-president of Corporate Communications at NEL operator SBS Transit said that the female commuter had \"slipped and caught her left leg in the 10cm gap\" between the platform and train. \"As a result of this incident, the train was held back at the station, causing service to be delayed on the line. Public address announcements were made to inform commuters about the delay,” she added. The crowds dispersed by 9:30am, but no notice of the train delays were posted on social media by SBS Transit, which operates the North East Line. (Yahoo, 11 Mar 2015)",

As a result train services between Marina Bay and Newton both bounds were affected. Engineers were immediately deployed on site while free bus services and bus bridging were made available. At around 10.30pm, both defective trains were recovered. Services resumed at 10.40pm, while free bus services and bus bridging remain available. After the apparent service recovery, however, trains were travelling slower from Marina Bay to Bishan north bound, according to SMRT\u0027s tweet at 10:47pm. Bus bridging ceased at 11:30pm.",

The disruption started just slightly after 6.00am this morning and full service resumed at about 3.00pm. The disruption was caused by the dislocation of two pairs of steady arms holding the contact wire of the Overhead Catenary System power supply line at the crossover between the North and South tunnels near Punggol. This is the first time that the steady arms have dislodged. As a result, power supply between Punggol (NE17) and Sengkang (NE16) was cut. Service continued to run between Buangkok (NE15) and HarbourFront (NE1). During the disruption, to enable commuters to continue on their journey between Punggol (NE17) and Sengkang (NE16) stations, close to 40 shuttle buses were in operation. Commuters were also able to board passing bus services for free at designated bus stops at the affected stations. More than 70 Goodwill Ambassadors and Traffic Inspectors were at the affected stations to assist commuters. We deeply apologise to some 18,000 passengers who were affected by the disruption.

Investigations found that SMRT’s Project Team for sleeper replacement works had failed to remove a Short Circuiting Clamp (SCC) that was installed. This was a breach to operating procedures for re-sleepering works. Since the incident, SMRT has enhanced its work processes to better account for all equipment used for sleeper replacement works.

    "description": "Train services on the Circle Line slowed to a crawl during the rush-hour commute yesterday, as another signalling fault — the third in four days — hit the MRT network. Operator SMRT said train services on the line were affected between 6am to 9am yesterday, after a defective signal connector was found between Mountbatten and Stadium MRT stations. This added about 20 minutes of travelling time for commuters, as trains ran at slower speeds and SMRT engineers tried to rectify the fault. SMRT spokesperson Alina Boey said additional trains were deployed to cope with the crowd build-up along the line. (TODAY, 28 Feb 2014)",

Safety measures kicked in and as a result, train services between the four stations were disrupted. During the disruption, two trains were re-routed as a safety precaution. About 180 passengers on one train were re-routed to Simei MRT Station, while another 200 passengers on the other train had to alight at Expo MRT Station.

    "description": "A damaged cable at one-north station caused a power failure that disrupted train services at 23 out of 30 Circle Line stations and affected about 2,900 commuters late on Wednesday night. About 300 passengers from three trains had to disembark and walk along the tracks to the nearest stations - Caldecott and Tai Seng. A Land Transport Authority (LTA) spokesman said preliminary investigations found that the contractor who had been replacing power cables at one-north station - between Buona Vista and Kent Ridge - had damaged one, resulting in a power trip. The power failure occurred at 11.21pm and affected 23 stations from HarbourFront to Stadium, said SMRT, which deployed its engineers on site to \"restore traction power to the rest of the network\". Power resumed only at 4am, several hours after train service ended at 12.30am. (ST, 22 Dec 2013)",

The disruption was caused by a southbound train that had stalled after departing Buangkok station. As the fault could not be reset locally, SBST carried out a train push-out operation5 to move the stalled train to Hougang station for passengers to disembark. However, the push-out operation failed due to procedural errors made by SBST’s recovery team. Due to the protracted delay, SBST had to conduct train-to-track detrainment for the 250 passengers on board the stalled train. However, SBST failed to meet the requirement6 for such detrainment to commence within 30 minutes after the train had stalled. (LTA News Release, 1 Oct 2013)",

Transport operator SMRT said trains between Yio Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio stations will move at a slower speed of 40km per hour, instead of the usual 80km per hour. In a Facebook post, SMRT said the slowdown would continue until the end of operation hours Thursday and it would change the rail on the track between the two stations after. The move comes after Southbound MRT services between Woodlands and Dhoby Ghaut stations were affected on Thursday at 6.25am due to the rail crack. G-clamps have since been installed to secure the rail joint (Yahoo, 30 May 2013). SMRT said on Friday that the rail crack was caused by a corroded metal strip which caused the underside of the rail to weaken and crack.",

    "description": "On the Circle Line, a track problem at Paya Lebar delayed trains travelling towards HarbourFront. On its Twitter feed, rail operator SMRT advised commuters to expect an extra five minutes of travelling time between Paya Lebar and MacPherson. The longer travelling time between these two stations led to delays farther down the line from Dhoby Ghaut. SMRT also called in staff to manually drive the trains between Dakota and MacPherson to navigate the fault. Circle Line trains began running normally again more than four hours after the fault took place around 8am. An SMRT spokesman said it took some time to rectify the fault as trains were still actively running across the affected stretch. (ST, 3 Jan 2012)",

In a statement, the company said that at 4:03pm, a train heading towards HarbourFront was immobilised by a self-activating emergency brake while approaching Serangoon Station, and remained that way despite attempts to reset it. In order that the faulty train could be taken off the main line, service was disrupted between Punggol and LIttle India stations while train service could continue between HarbourFront and Dhoby Gaut stations. At 5:03pm service from HarbourFront towards Punggol resumed and by 5:06pm service in the other direction was fully restored, the company recounted. (Yahoo, 20 Dec 2012)",

At certain times, the delay was longer - at up to 50 minutes. The cause of the initial delay has been traced to a fault in the traction power system where a stainless steel U-shaped bolt holding the cantilever arm of the overhead power cables broke in the northbound tunNorth-East Line between HarbourFront and Outram Park Stations. The signalling fault which had been discovered at 2.45pm today on the Northeast Line has been fixed. Train frequencies however continue to be lower due to the traction power fault which will only be resolved at the end of revenue service today. Goodwill ambassadors are being deployed to stations that have high passenger traffic such as Harbourfront and Outram Park Stations. Free bus shuttles are being activated and will run during the evening peak period from 5.30pm along the entire line.",

    "description": "SMRT said there was a 30-minute train service delay between Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah MRT stations Friday evening. This was due to a fault on a westbound train between Tampines and Simei station. SMRT said the train travelling behind the stalled train was used to assist it. Passengers on board the stalled train alighted at Simei station at 7.36pm, while passengers on the assisting train alighted at 7.43pm. SMRT said that eastbound passengers between City Hall and Pasir Ris MRT stations would have experienced a general service delay for a 20 to 40-minute period, as the high train frequencies operated during the rush hour can lead to a congestion when there is a train fault (CNA, 13 Apr 2012). Pressure from pneumatic system, which powers train doors and brakes, fell below operating limit because of faulty control circuit (ST, 25 Apr 2012).",

To mantain service, a shuttle train service was operated between Seragoon and Caldecott stations at 5.54am, and passengers travelling beyond this stretch in either direction needed to make a transfer at Serangoon and Caldecott to continue their journey. This lasted till around 6.22am, before normal train services resumed. Around 100 passengers at these three stations experienced delays of around 10 and 28 minutes. (Today, 31 Mar 2012)",

The primary cause for the broken wires was corrosion. Laboratory tests revealed that the majority of wire strands of the snapped wires had broken due to Stress Corrosion Cracking. This is a gradual process of propagation of cracks in the wire strands due to contact with tunNorth-East Line seepage water. LTA\u0027s findings further revealed that SBST had not carried out immediate diversion/rectification works on tunNorth-East Line leaks at the incident site, and was not sufficiently diligent in detecting and replacing the corroded wires.",
